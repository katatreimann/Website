        <p class="whoiam"> I'm from Estonia. Living in London for the last four years. I have studied Textiles and a bit of Graphic Design. I have always been interested in too many things at once. Wanted to do everything at once. And I've always had the attitude that if you want something, go and do it. Is it a pair of shoes, a ceramic tableware or travelling alone.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the midst of my too many interests, I have always struggled with which way to go. So far, I've made decisions thoughtfully and mostly with common sense. There have been exciting experiences, but not lasting ones. I haven't really recognized myself anywhere.
        <br>
        <br>
        The more time went by, the clearer the criteria became for what I expect from my future job. The two most important of these are that it has to be creative and I can do it wherever I am. What that might be, I had no idea until I found Founders and Coders.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I started coding thanks to FAC, I realized how much of my previous thoughts were all rolled into one. I'm glad it came to me naturally and not through thinking. It was a very quick realisation. In addition, I really like the learning opportunity offered by FAC. I have always found peer to peer and apprenticeships to be the most appropriate form of learning.
        <br>
        <br>
        I want to enter the world of web development because I really enjoy it. I've never been so sure of anything. I enjoy the challenges and problem solving through creativity.</p>
